Unity version - 2022.3.12f1

The scene might not appear when you first cloned the project.
Go to 'Scenes' folder in the project menu 
and choose the scene to start working on the project.

Keep all scenes in the same folder to make it organized.

If you want to change something from the project,
make sure to create branch and make your changes.
The merge conflict is very common in Unity using GitHub.

Go to 'Game' tab in upper window and change the Aspect Ratio to 16:9
everytime you download or clone the project.
The aspect ratio is not saved in GitHub, and it is indeed weird.

Do not delete gitattributes and gitignore.
This is all you should have to know for this repository.
Do not hesitate to communicate if you have any questions!
